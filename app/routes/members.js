Such guitar players as Wylde, Vaughan, and Satriani are just a few to name that have inspired him to play in past hard rock and metal bands in the Bay Area. Having the opportunity to perform pieces from the US and Europe\'s most well known Symphonic Metal acts, the honor and excitement has been prodigious. He is looking forward to the band\'s future and to get to share his creative energy towards their music.'
